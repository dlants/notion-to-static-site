# notion-to-static-site
Convert your public notion page into a collection of static files.

## TODO
style page, header
media queries for mobile styling
favicon
update pageUrls to use pageIds / hashes, to make links more permanent (so they don't change if the page gets renamed)
generate rss files for each section
fixup embeds (video, collapsible sections, etc...)
add automatic "next post / previous post" links for multiple pages in the same section
add #naviation links to each title / subtitle
check the build results into the repo, set up render to mirror repo to website

## MAYBE
consider using the notion api to fetch pages / blocks, rather than relying on manual export of html
